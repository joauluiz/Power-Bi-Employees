# Power-Bi-Employees

As a recent Power Bi user at that time, I was excited to have the opportunity to test my skills by creating a employee panel using the tool.

Using Power Bi's intuitive interface, I was able to easily import and organize data from various sources using Power Query, including employee performance evaluations and attendance records. From there, I was able to create visually appealing charts and graphs to display the data in a clear and concise manner.

One of my favorite features of Power Bi was the ability to customize the panel to fit my specific needs. For example, I was able to highlight high-performing employees.

Overall, creating the employee panel in Power Bi was a valuable learning experience and I am grateful for the opportunity to practice using this powerful tool. I am confident that the skills I have gained will be useful in my future career and I am excited to continue learning and exploring the capabilities of Power Bi.
